# rockPaperJS

This game is based on machine learning, it uses the webcam to get the input from the user.
I have used transfer learning to retrain mobilenet's model for classification of rock paper scissor.
HTML, CSS and Tensorflow JS are used in this project.


# HOW TO PLAY :

1) Click on the train button.
2) Click several times (at least 10) on each image, while making the same sign with your hands,
  ie if you are clicking rock when make rock with your hands it front of the camera.
3) Once all the classes are trained, click on the done button.
4) Make the sign of your choice, then click play, the game will automatically detect what sign are you making out of 
rock, paper or scissor.

#Enjoy
